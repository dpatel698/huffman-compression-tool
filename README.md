# Huffman Encoder/Decoder

## Overview

This project implements a Huffman coding algorithm for lossless data compression and decompression of text files. The tool reads a text file, calculates the frequency of each character, builds a binary tree based on these frequencies, generates a prefix code table, and encodes the text accordingly. The encoded data can then be decoded back to its original form.

## Features

- Compress text files using Huffman coding.
- Decompress previously compressed files.
- Efficient handling of character frequencies.
- Command-line interface for ease of use.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Required libraries: `collections`, `heapq`, `base64`

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/huffman-encoder-decoder.git
   cd huffman-encoder-decoder

Ensure you have Python installed. You can check this by running:
bash
python --version

Usage
To compress a text file:
bash
python huffman.py -e <filename>

To decompress a compressed file:
bash
python huffman.py -d <filename>

Example
Compressing a file:
bash
python huffman.py -e les_miserables.txt

Decompressing a file:
bash
python huffman.py -d compressed_les_miserables.txt

Steps to Implement
Calculate Character Frequencies: Read the input text file and determine the frequency of each character.
Build the Binary Tree: Use the frequencies to construct a Huffman tree.
Generate Prefix Code Table: Create a mapping of characters to binary codes based on the tree.
Write Header Section: Include necessary information in the output file for decoding.
Encode the Text: Convert the text into a binary string using the prefix codes and write it to an output file.
Decode the Text: Read the header from the compressed file and reconstruct the prefix table.
Write Decompressed Output: Decode the binary string back to the original text and save it to a file.
Testing
To ensure the correctness of the implementation, you can create unit tests for each of the major functions. Consider using Python's built-in unittest framework.
Example Test
python
import unittest

class TestHuffmanCoding(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_character_frequencies(self):
        frequencies = get_char_frequencies('test_file.txt')
        self.assertEqual(frequencies['a'], expected_value)
