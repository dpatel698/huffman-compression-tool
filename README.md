# Huffman Compression Tool

## Description

This project implements the classic Huffman coding tree algorithm for lossless data compression and decompression of text files. The tool reads a text file, calculates the frequency of each character, builds a binary tree based on these frequencies, generates a prefix code table, and encodes the text accordingly. The encoded data can then be decoded back to its original form.

## Features

- Compress text files using Huffman coding.
- Decompress previously compressed files.
- Efficient handling of character frequencies.
- Command-line interface for ease of use.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/huffman-encoder-decoder.git
   cd huffman-compression-tool

Ensure you have Python installed. You can check this by running:

```bash
python --version
```

# Usage
To compress a text file:
```bash
python huffmancompress.py -e <filename>
```

To decompress a compressed file:
```bash
python huffmancompress.py -d <filename>
```

# Steps to Implement
1. Calculate Character Frequencies: Read the input text file and determine the frequency of each character.
2. Build the Binary Tree: Use the frequencies to construct a Huffman tree.
3. Generate Prefix Code Table: Create a mapping of characters to binary codes based on the tree.
4. Write Header Section: Include necessary information in the output file for decoding.
5. Encode the Text: Convert the text into a binary string using the prefix codes and write it to an output file.
6. Decode the Text: Read the header from the compressed file and reconstruct the prefix table.
7. Write Decompressed Output: Decode the binary string back to the original text and save it to a file.
