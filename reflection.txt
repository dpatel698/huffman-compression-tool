Summary:
Compression tool that uses Huffman Coding to compress and decompress text files.

Lessons:
1. Compression trades time requirements for space requirements (compressing and decompress).
2. Huffman Coding uses search tries for assigning variable length codes to characters.
   More frequent characters are assigned shorter binary codes.
3. dict.update() used recursively to build a prefix table in HuffmanTree class
